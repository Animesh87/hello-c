## 4.2 Starting your Program

`run`
`r`

    Use the run command to start your program under GDB. You must first specify the program name with an argument to GDB (see Getting In and Out of GDB), or by using the file or exec-file command (see Commands to Specify Files).

`start`

    The name of the main procedure can vary from language to language. With C or C++, the main procedure name is always **main**, but other languages such as Ada do not require a specific name for their main procedure. The debugger provides a convenient way to start the execution of the program and to stop at the beginning of the main procedure, depending on the language used.

    The ‘start’ command does the equivalent of setting a temporary breakpoint at the beginning of the main procedure and then invoking the ‘run’ command.

set exec-wrapper wrapper
show exec-wrapper
unset exec-wrapper

    When ‘exec-wrapper’ is set, the specified wrapper is used to launch programs for debugging. GDB starts your program with a shell command of the form exec wrapper program. Quoting is added to program and its arguments, but not to wrapper, so you should add quotes if appropriate for your shell. The wrapper runs until it executes your program, and then GDB takes control.

    You can use any program that eventually calls execve with its arguments as a wrapper. Several standard Unix utilities do this, e.g. env and nohup. Any Unix shell script ending with exec "$@" will also work.

    For example, you can use env to pass an environment variable to the debugged program, without setting the variable in your shell’s environment:

    (gdb) set exec-wrapper env 'LD_PRELOAD=libtest.so'
    (gdb) run

```
# gdb -q a.out
Reading symbols from a.out...done.
