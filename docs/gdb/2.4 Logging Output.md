You may want to save the output of GDB commands to a file. There are several commands to control GDBâ€™s logging.

`set logging on`
Enable logging.

`set logging off`
Disable logging.

`set logging file file`
Change the name of the current logfile. The default logfile is gdb.txt.

`set logging overwrite [on|off]`
By default, GDB will append to the logfile. Set overwrite if you want set logging on to overwrite the logfile instead.

`set logging redirect [on|off]`
By default, GDB output will go to both the terminal and the logfile. Set redirect if you want output to go only to the log file.

`show logging`
Show the current values of the logging settings.

```
root@labs:~# gdb --silent
(gdb) show logging 
Future logs will be written to gdb.txt.
Logs will be appended to the log file.
Output will be logged and displayed.
