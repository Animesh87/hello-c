## 3.2 Command Completion

GDB can fill in the rest of a word in a command for you, if there is only one possibility; it can also show you what the valid possibilities are for the next word in a command, at any time. This works for GDB commands, GDB subcommands, and the names of symbols in your program.

Press the TAB key whenever you want GDB to fill out the rest of a word. If there is only one possibility, GDB fills in the word, and waits for you to finish the command (or press RET to enter it). For example, if you type

`(gdb) info bre TAB`
GDB fills in the rest of the word ‘breakpoints’, since that is the only info subcommand beginning with ‘bre’:

`(gdb) info breakpoints`

`set max-completions limit`
`set max-completions unlimited`
    Set the maximum number of completion candidates. GDB will stop looking for more completions once it collects this many candidates. This is useful when completing on things like function names as collecting all the possible candidates can be time consuming. The default value is 200. A value of zero disables tab-completion. Note that setting either no limit or a very large limit can make completion slow.

`show max-completions`
    Show the maximum number of candidates that GDB will collect and show during completion.

```
(gdb) show max-completions 
Maximum number of completion candidates is 200.
(gdb) set max-completions 2
(gdb) info a

*** List may be truncated, max-completions reached. ***
