## 4.4 Your Programâ€™s Environment

The environment consists of a set of environment variables and their values. Environment variables conventionally record such things as your user name, your home directory, your terminal type, and your search path for programs to run. Usually you set up environment variables with the shell and they are inherited by all the other programs you run. When debugging, it can be useful to try running your program with a modified environment without having to start GDB over again.

`path directory`
`show paths`
`show environment [varname]`
`set environment varname [=value]`
`unset environment varname`
