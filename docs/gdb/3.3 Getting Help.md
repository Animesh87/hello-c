## 3.3 Getting Help

You can always ask GDB itself for information on its commands, using the command help.

`help`
`h`

You can use help (abbreviated h) with no arguments to display a short list of named classes of commands:

```
(gdb) help 
List of classes of commands:

aliases -- Aliases of other commands
breakpoints -- Making program stop at certain points
data -- Examining data
files -- Specifying and examining files
internals -- Maintenance commands
obscure -- Obscure features
running -- Running the program
stack -- Examining the stack
status -- Status inquiries
support -- Support facilities
tracepoints -- Tracing of program execution without stopping the program
user-defined -- User-defined commands

Type "help" followed by a class name for a list of commands in that class.
Type "help all" for the list of all commands.
Type "help" followed by command name for full documentation.
Type "apropos word" to search for commands related to "word".
Command name abbreviations are allowed if unambiguous.
```

`help class`

Using one of the general help classes as an argument, you can get a list of the individual commands in that class. For example, here is the help display for the class status:

```

(gdb) help status
Status inquiries.

List of commands:

info -- Generic command for showing things
        about the program being debugged
show -- Generic command for showing things
        about the debugger

Type "help" followed by command name for full
documentation.
Command name abbreviations are allowed if unambiguous.
(gdb)
```

`help command`

With a command name as help argument, GDB displays a short paragraph on how to use that command.

`apropos args`

The apropos command searches through all of the GDB commands, and their documentation, for the regular expression specified in args. It prints out all matches found. For example:

```
apropos alias
```

results in:

```
alias -- Define a new command that is an alias of an existing command
aliases -- Aliases of other commands
d -- Delete some breakpoints or auto-display expressions
del -- Delete some breakpoints or auto-display expressions
delete -- Delete some breakpoints or auto-display expressions
```

`complete args`

The complete args command lists all the possible completions for the beginning of a command. Use args to specify the beginning of the command you want completed. For example:

```
complete i
```

results in:

```
if
ignore
info
inspect
```

This is intended for use by GNU Emacs.
