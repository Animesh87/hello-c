## Data Structure

In computer science, a data structure is a data organization and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. In C language Different types of data structures are; Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List, Tree.

- An **array** is a number of elements in a specific order, typically all of the same type. Elements are accessed using an integer index to specify which element is required (Depending on the language, individual elements may either all be forced to be the same type, or may be of almost any type). Typical implementations allocate contiguous memory words for the elements of arrays (but this is not always a necessity). Arrays may be fixed-length or resizable.

- A **linked list** (also just called list) is a linear collection of data elements of any type, called nodes, where each node has itself a value, and points to the next node on the linked list. The principal advantage of a linked list over an array, is that values can always be efficiently inserted and removed without relocating the rest of the list. Certain other operations, such as random access to a certain element, are however slower on lists than on arrays.

- A **record** (also called tuple or struct) is an aggregate data structure. A record is a value that contains other values, typically in fixed number and sequence and typically indexed by names. The elements of records are usually called fields or members.

- A **union** is a data structure that specifies which of a number of permitted primitive types may be stored in its instances, e.g. float or long integer. Constrast with a record, which could be defined to contain a float and an integer; whereas in a union, there is only one value at a time. Eough space is allocated to contain the widest member datatype.

- A **tagged union** (also called variant, variant record, discriminated union, or disjoint union) contains an additional field indicating its current type, for enhanced type safety.

- A **class** is a data structure that contains data field, like a record, as well as various methods which operate on the contents of the record. In the context of object-oriented programming, records are known as plain old data structures to distinguish them form classes.

- A **stack** is a basic data structure that can be logically though of as a linear structure represented by a real physical stack or pile, a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack. The basic implementation of a stack is also called a LIFO (Last In First Out) to demonstrate the way it accesses data, since as we will see there are various variations of stack implementations.

- A **queue** is a basic data structure that is used throughout programming. You can think of it as a line in a grocery store. The first one in the line is the first one to be served. Just like a queue.

- A **linked list** is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (we will call it a node) of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. The last node has a reference to null. The number of nodes in a list is not fixed and can grow and shrink on demand.

- A **tree** is a widely used abstract data type (ADT) -- or data structure implementing this ADT -- that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

## Algorithm

An algorithm is a finite set instruction, which is written for solve any problem. Algorithm is not the complete code or program, it is just like a English language.
