## C Standard Library

C is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the Unix operating system.

C is the most widely used computer language, that keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers.

The C Standard Library is a set of C built-in functions, constants and header files like <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <math.h>, etc. This library will work as a reference manual for C programmers.

```
assert.h
ctype.h
errno.h
float.h
limits.h
locale.h
math.h
setjmp.h
signal.h
stdarg.h
stdio.h
stdlib.h
string.h
time.h
```

The C Standard Library is a reference for C programmers to help them in their projects related to system programming. All the C functions have been explained in a user-friendly way and they can be copied and pasted in your C projects.
